Assume you're responsible for my education in becoming a machine learning engineer. I am a current student of yours. Deliver a presentation on 'Introduction to Machine Learning.' Flag key concepts with the label '(important)' and include practical examples or code snippets to bridge theory and application. Use plain language to avoid excessive technical jargon, ensuring clarity in your explanations. Aim for a comprehensive yet digestible depth of content. Always finalize with a summary of key takeaways. Include references to external resources for further check (text/video), if possible.
