### Deployment

Deploying your smart contracts involves configuring your network settings, writing deployment scripts, and executing these scripts to deploy your contracts to a blockchain network.

**Configuring Network Settings in `hardhat.config.js`:**

Before deploying, you need to configure the network settings in your `hardhat.config.js` file.

1. Open `hardhat.config.js`.
2. Add network configurations. Hereâ€™s an example configuration for the Hardhat Network and the sepolia testnet:

   ```javascript
   require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle');

   module.exports = {
     solidity: '0.8.0',
     networks: {
       hardhat: {},
       sepolia: {
         url: 'https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID',
         accounts: ['0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY'],
       },
     },
   };
   ```

   - **hardhat:** The default local network provided by Hardhat.
   - **sepolia:** Configuration for the sepolia testnet. Replace `YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID` with your Infura project ID and `0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with your Ethereum account's private key.

### Using Ignition for Deployment

#### Overview

Hardhat Ignition simplifies the deployment of Ethereum smart contracts by using a declarative approach. Here's how you can use it in a TypeScript project.

#### Installation

1. Ensure you have Hardhat (v2.18.0+) and Ethers.js (v6+).
2. In your Hardhat project's root directory, run:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition-ethers typescript ts-node
   ```

3. Add the plugin in your `hardhat.config.ts`:

   ```typescript
   import '@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition-ethers';
   ```

#### Creating a Smart Contract

Create a simple contract `Rocket.sol` in the `contracts` directory:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Rocket {
    string public name;
    string public status;

    constructor(string memory _name) {
        name = _name;
        status = "ignition";
    }

    function launch() public {
        status = "lift-off";
    }
}
```

#### Defining an Ignition Module

Create a module to deploy your contract. In `ignition/modules/Apollo.ts`:

```typescript
import { buildModule } from '@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules';

module.exports = buildModule('Apollo', (m) => {
  const apollo = m.contract('Rocket', ['Saturn V']);
  m.call(apollo, 'launch', []);
  return { apollo };
});
```

#### Deploying the Module

1. Start a local Hardhat node:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

2. Deploy the module:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Apollo.ts --network localhost
   ```

This TypeScript setup allows Hardhat Ignition to manage the deployment and initialization steps efficiently, providing a robust framework for smart contract operations on Ethereum.

### Deprecated way (without Ignition)

**Writing Deployment Scripts:**

Deployment scripts automate the process of deploying your contracts to the specified network.

1. Create a new script named `deploy.js` in the `scripts/` directory.

   ```javascript
   async function main() {
     // We get the contract to deploy
     const SimpleStorage = await ethers.getContractFactory('SimpleStorage');
     const simpleStorage = await SimpleStorage.deploy();

     await simpleStorage.deployed();

     console.log('SimpleStorage deployed to:', simpleStorage.address);
   }

   main()
     .then(() => process.exit(0))
     .catch((error) => {
       console.error(error);
       process.exit(1);
     });
   ```

2. **Explanation:**

   - **ethers.getContractFactory:** Gets the contract factory for the `SimpleStorage` contract.
   - **deploy:** Deploys the contract.
   - **await simpleStorage.deployed:** Waits for the deployment to complete.
   - **console.log:** Logs the address where the contract was deployed.

**Deploying Contracts to a Local Blockchain (Hardhat Network):**

To deploy your contract to the local Hardhat Network:

1. Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hardhat
   ```

2. You should see output indicating that your contract was deployed successfully, along with the contract address.

**Deploying Contracts to Testnets (sepolia, Kovan, etc.):**

To deploy your contract to a testnet, make sure your `hardhat.config.js` file is properly configured for the testnet you want to use. Then, run the deployment script with the appropriate network flag.

1. Run the following command to deploy to sepolia:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
   ```

2. You will see output similar to the local deployment, but the contract address will correspond to the sepolia network.

**Verifying the Deployment:**

To verify your contract's deployment, you can use block explorers like Etherscan (for mainnet and testnets) or the Hardhat Network console for local deployments.

- **Local Deployment:** Use the Hardhat console to interact with your deployed contract.
- **Testnet/Mainnet Deployment:** Use Etherscan to view your contract and transactions.
