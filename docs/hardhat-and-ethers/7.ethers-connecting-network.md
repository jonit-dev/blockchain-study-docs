### Lesson 2: Connecting to the Ethereum Network

**Summary:** In this lesson, you will learn how to connect to various Ethereum networks (Mainnet, testnets, and custom networks) using Ethers.js providers. Providers are the connection points to the Ethereum network, allowing you to read blockchain data and interact with smart contracts.

#### 3. Connecting to the Ethereum Network

**Understanding Providers:**
Providers in Ethers.js are used to connect to the Ethereum network. They serve as a gateway for interacting with the blockchain, allowing you to query data and send transactions. Ethers.js supports multiple types of providers, including JSON-RPC, Etherscan, Infura, and Alchemy.

**Common Providers:**

- **JSON-RPC Provider:** Direct connection to an Ethereum node via JSON-RPC.
- **Infura Provider:** Connect to Infura's hosted Ethereum nodes.
- **Alchemy Provider:** Connect to Alchemy's enhanced Ethereum nodes.
- **Etherscan Provider:** Use Etherscanâ€™s API to interact with the blockchain.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Connecting with a JSON-RPC Provider:**

   - A JSON-RPC provider connects directly to an Ethereum node. If you have access to a local node or a remote node, you can use its URL.
   - Example code:

     ```js
     const { ethers } = require('ethers');

     // Connect to the local Ethereum node
     const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
       'http://localhost:8545',
     );

     async function main() {
       const blockNumber = await provider.getBlockNumber();
       console.log('Current block number:', blockNumber);
     }

     main();
     ```

2. **Connecting with Infura:**

   - Infura is a popular service providing easy access to Ethereum nodes. You'll need to sign up for an Infura account and get a project ID.
   - Example code:

     ```js
     const { ethers } = require('ethers');

     // Connect to Infura
     const infuraProjectId = 'your-infura-project-id';
     const provider = new ethers.providers.InfuraProvider(
       'mainnet',
       infuraProjectId,
     );

     async function main() {
       const blockNumber = await provider.getBlockNumber();
       console.log('Current block number:', blockNumber);
     }

     main();
     ```

3. **Connecting with Alchemy:**

   - Alchemy provides enhanced APIs and tools for Ethereum development. You'll need to sign up for an Alchemy account and get an API key.
   - Example code:

     ```js
     const { ethers } = require('ethers');

     // Connect to Alchemy
     const alchemyApiKey = 'your-alchemy-api-key';
     const provider = new ethers.providers.AlchemyProvider(
       'mainnet',
       alchemyApiKey,
     );

     async function main() {
       const blockNumber = await provider.getBlockNumber();
       console.log('Current block number:', blockNumber);
     }

     main();
     ```

4. **Connecting with Etherscan:**

   - Etherscan is a popular Ethereum block explorer that also provides APIs for blockchain interaction. You'll need an Etherscan API key.
   - Example code:

     ```js
     const { ethers } = require('ethers');

     // Connect to Etherscan
     const etherscanApiKey = 'your-etherscan-api-key';
     const provider = new ethers.providers.EtherscanProvider(
       'mainnet',
       etherscanApiKey,
     );

     async function main() {
       const blockNumber = await provider.getBlockNumber();
       console.log('Current block number:', blockNumber);
     }

     main();
     ```

**Choosing the Right Provider:**

- Use **JSON-RPC** for local or custom nodes.
- Use **Infura** or **Alchemy** for reliable and scalable connections, especially for production applications.
- Use **Etherscan** for quick access to read-only blockchain data.

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to connect to any Ethereum network using Ethers.js providers and retrieve basic blockchain information such as the current block number. This connection is the foundation for more complex interactions with the Ethereum blockchain, which you will explore in subsequent lessons.
