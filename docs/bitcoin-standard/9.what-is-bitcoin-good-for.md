**Chapter 9: What is Bitcoin Good For – Summary**

In Chapter 9 of _The Bitcoin Standard_, Saifedean Ammous explores the multifaceted utility of Bitcoin, highlighting its roles as a store of value, a tool for individual sovereignty, a medium for international and online settlements, and a potential global unit of account. Through clear explanations and illustrative examples, Ammous demonstrates how Bitcoin's unique properties make it a transformative force in the financial landscape.

### Store of Value

A fundamental attribute of Bitcoin is its capacity to serve as a store of value. Ammous argues that for money to function effectively as a store of value, it must possess certain characteristics: durability, portability, divisibility, fungibility, scarcity, and resistance to censorship and confiscation.

**Durability and Portability:** Bitcoin exists digitally, making it inherently durable against physical degradation. Its portability allows users to transfer significant value across the globe instantly, without the constraints of physical transportation.

**Divisibility and Fungibility:** Bitcoin can be divided into satoshis (the smallest unit), enabling precise transactions. Its fungibility ensures that each unit is interchangeable, maintaining uniformity in value.

**Scarcity:** Bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million coins, creating inherent scarcity. This limited supply protects against inflationary pressures that erode the value of fiat currencies over time.

**Resistance to Censorship and Confiscation:** Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous and decentralized, making it difficult for authorities to censor or seize assets. This feature is particularly valuable in regions with unstable or oppressive governments.

**Example:** Consider a citizen in a country experiencing hyperinflation, such as Venezuela. By converting their local currency into Bitcoin, they can preserve their wealth against rapid devaluation, ensuring that their savings retain value over time.

**Main Takeaway:** Bitcoin's properties of scarcity, durability, portability, divisibility, and resistance to censorship make it an exceptional store of value, safeguarding wealth against inflation and economic instability.

### Individual Sovereignty

Bitcoin empowers individuals by enhancing financial sovereignty—the ability to control one's own assets without reliance on intermediaries like banks or governments. Ammous emphasizes that financial sovereignty is a cornerstone of personal freedom and autonomy.

**Control Over Assets:** With Bitcoin, individuals hold their private keys, granting them direct control over their funds. This eliminates the need to trust third parties, reducing the risk of asset seizure or loss due to institutional failures.

**Privacy and Anonymity:** Bitcoin transactions offer a higher degree of privacy compared to traditional financial systems. While transactions are recorded on the public blockchain, users can maintain anonymity by using multiple addresses and safeguarding their identity.

**Resistance to Censorship:** Bitcoin's decentralized nature ensures that no single entity can block or reverse transactions. This feature is crucial for individuals in oppressive regimes or those engaging in activities that may be restricted by authorities.

**Example:** An entrepreneur operating in a country with strict capital controls can use Bitcoin to transfer earnings internationally without government interference, preserving their ability to reinvest and grow their business freely.

**Main Takeaway:** Bitcoin enhances individual sovereignty by providing direct control over financial assets, ensuring privacy, and protecting against censorship, thereby promoting personal freedom and autonomy.

### International and Online Settlement

Bitcoin facilitates seamless international and online settlements by providing a universal, borderless medium of exchange. Ammous highlights the advantages of Bitcoin in reducing the friction associated with cross-border transactions.

**Speed and Efficiency:** Traditional international transfers can take several days and involve multiple intermediaries, leading to delays and increased costs. Bitcoin transactions can be settled within minutes, regardless of geographical distance.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** By eliminating intermediaries such as banks and payment processors, Bitcoin reduces transaction fees. This makes it an attractive option for remittances, international trade, and online commerce.

**Accessibility:** Bitcoin is accessible to anyone with an internet connection, enabling financial inclusion for unbanked populations and facilitating global commerce without the need for traditional banking infrastructure.

**Example:** A freelancer in India receiving payments from clients in the United States can use Bitcoin to receive funds instantly and with lower fees compared to traditional wire transfers, enhancing their earnings and reducing transaction costs.

**Main Takeaway:** Bitcoin streamlines international and online settlements by offering fast, cost-effective, and accessible transactions, overcoming the limitations of traditional financial systems.

### Global Unit of Account

A significant potential of Bitcoin is its ability to function as a global unit of account—a standardized measure of value that transcends national borders and currencies. Ammous explores the implications of adopting Bitcoin as a universal metric for pricing and economic calculations.

**Consistency and Stability:** Unlike fiat currencies, which can fluctuate based on national economic policies and conditions, Bitcoin's fixed supply and decentralized nature provide a more stable and consistent unit of account.

**Unified Pricing:** A global unit of account simplifies international trade and investment by providing a common reference point, reducing the complexities associated with currency conversions and exchange rate volatility.

**Innovation and Integration:** As Bitcoin gains widespread adoption, it can integrate with emerging technologies and financial systems, fostering innovation in areas such as smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and programmable money.

**Example:** Imagine a multinational corporation using Bitcoin as its primary unit of account for pricing products and services worldwide. This approach eliminates the need for multiple currency pricing strategies, simplifies financial reporting, and mitigates the risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations.

**Main Takeaway:** Bitcoin's potential as a global unit of account lies in its consistency, stability, and universality, which can simplify international economic activities and promote seamless global integration.

### Appendix to Chapter 9

The appendix in Chapter 9 provides supplementary insights and technical details that support the main discussions on Bitcoin's utility. It delves into real-world applications, case studies, and advanced concepts that illustrate Bitcoin's versatility and potential impact on various aspects of the economy and society.
