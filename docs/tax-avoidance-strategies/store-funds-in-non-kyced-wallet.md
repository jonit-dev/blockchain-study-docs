### Strategies to Avoid Tax Legally

### 1) Canada: Make Use of RRSP and TFSA

- **Fill all of your RRSP and TFSA with BTC ETFs:**
  - Contribute the maximum allowable amounts to your RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) and TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) with investments in Bitcoin ETFs.
  - **RRSP Benefits:** Contributions are tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income, and the investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
  - **TFSA Benefits:** Investments grow tax-free, and withdrawals are also tax-free.
  - **Avoiding Deemed Disposition:** When you lose tax residency in Canada, assets in RRSP and TFSA are not subject to deemed disposition rules, which trigger capital gains tax.

### 2) Stealth Fortress Strategy

- Basically this strategy involves buying MATIC in a CEX, using a bridge like Rubic to convert it to Monero, do multiple swap to erase traces, and use Rubic again to get the desired tokens, but now stored in NON-KYCD wallets.
