### Strategies to Avoid Tax Legally

### 1) Canada: Make Use of RRSP and TFSA

- **Fill all of your RRSP and TFSA with BTC ETFs:**
  - Contribute the maximum allowable amounts to your RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) and TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) with investments in Bitcoin ETFs.
  - **RRSP Benefits:** Contributions are tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income, and the investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
  - **TFSA Benefits:** Investments grow tax-free, and withdrawals are also tax-free.
  - **Avoiding Deemed Disposition:** When you lose tax residency in Canada, assets in RRSP and TFSA are not subject to deemed disposition rules, which trigger capital gains tax.

### 2) Cashing Out Non-KYCd Wallets

1. **Convert Funds to Monero via Rubic:**

   - Use Rubic to convert your funds to Monero (XMR), a cryptocurrency known for its privacy features.

2. **Transfer Monero to Multiple Wallets:**

   - Transfer Monero from MoneroWallet1 to MoneroWallet2 to enhance privacy and minimize traceability.

3. **Transfer to Non-KYC Wallet:**

   - Transfer Monero from MoneroWallet2 to a non-KYC wallet to maintain anonymity.

4. **Store in Hardware Wallet:**

   - Transfer the crypto assets from the non-KYC wallet to a hardware wallet for added security.

5. **Change Tax Residency:**

   - Declare your exit from Canada and officially change your tax residency to Brazil.

6. **Gradual Sale from Hardware Wallet:**
   - Gradually transfer crypto assets from the hardware wallet to the non-KYC wallet for sale, ensuring each transaction respects the BRL 35,000 per month exemption to avoid triggering tax events.
