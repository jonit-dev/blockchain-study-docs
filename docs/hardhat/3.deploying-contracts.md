### Deployment

Deploying your smart contracts involves configuring your network settings, writing deployment scripts, and executing these scripts to deploy your contracts to a blockchain network.

**Configuring Network Settings in `hardhat.config.js`:**

Before deploying, you need to configure the network settings in your `hardhat.config.js` file.

1. Open `hardhat.config.js`.
2. Add network configurations. Here’s an example configuration for the Hardhat Network and the Rinkeby testnet:

   ```javascript
   require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle');

   module.exports = {
     solidity: '0.8.0',
     networks: {
       hardhat: {},
       rinkeby: {
         url: 'https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID',
         accounts: ['0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY'],
       },
     },
   };
   ```

   - **hardhat:** The default local network provided by Hardhat.
   - **rinkeby:** Configuration for the Rinkeby testnet. Replace `YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID` with your Infura project ID and `0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with your Ethereum account's private key.

**Writing Deployment Scripts:**

Deployment scripts automate the process of deploying your contracts to the specified network.

1. Create a new script named `deploy.js` in the `scripts/` directory.

   ```javascript
   async function main() {
     // We get the contract to deploy
     const SimpleStorage = await ethers.getContractFactory('SimpleStorage');
     const simpleStorage = await SimpleStorage.deploy();

     await simpleStorage.deployed();

     console.log('SimpleStorage deployed to:', simpleStorage.address);
   }

   main()
     .then(() => process.exit(0))
     .catch((error) => {
       console.error(error);
       process.exit(1);
     });
   ```

2. **Explanation:**

   - **ethers.getContractFactory:** Gets the contract factory for the `SimpleStorage` contract.
   - **deploy:** Deploys the contract.
   - **await simpleStorage.deployed:** Waits for the deployment to complete.
   - **console.log:** Logs the address where the contract was deployed.

**Deploying Contracts to a Local Blockchain (Hardhat Network):**

To deploy your contract to the local Hardhat Network:

1. Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hardhat
   ```

2. You should see output indicating that your contract was deployed successfully, along with the contract address.

**Deploying Contracts to Testnets (Rinkeby, Kovan, etc.):**

To deploy your contract to a testnet, make sure your `hardhat.config.js` file is properly configured for the testnet you want to use. Then, run the deployment script with the appropriate network flag.

1. Run the following command to deploy to Rinkeby:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
   ```

2. You will see output similar to the local deployment, but the contract address will correspond to the Rinkeby network.

**Verifying the Deployment:**

To verify your contract's deployment, you can use block explorers like Etherscan (for mainnet and testnets) or the Hardhat Network console for local deployments.

- **Local Deployment:** Use the Hardhat console to interact with your deployed contract.
- **Testnet/Mainnet Deployment:** Use Etherscan to view your contract and transactions.

#### Using @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules for Deployment

`@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules` is a powerful tool for managing and automating the deployment of smart contracts. It allows you to define deployment modules and manage complex deployment processes more efficiently.

**Installation:**

First, you need to install the Ignition plugin:

```bash
npm install @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition
```

Then, add it to your `hardhat.config.js` file:

```javascript
require('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition');

// Other existing configurations

module.exports = {
  solidity: '0.8.0',
  // Existing configurations
};
```

**Creating Deployment Modules:**

Deployment modules in Ignition are JavaScript files that define how your contracts should be deployed. Let’s create a deployment module for the `SimpleStorage` contract.

1. Create a new directory named `deployments/` in your project root.
2. Inside `deployments/`, create a file named `simpleStorage.js`.

   ```javascript
   const { ethers } = require('hardhat');

   module.exports = async ({ deployments, getNamedAccounts }) => {
     const { deploy } = deployments;
     const { deployer } = await getNamedAccounts();

     await deploy('SimpleStorage', {
       from: deployer,
       args: [],
       log: true,
     });
   };
   ```

**Explanation:**

- **deployments:** Provides access to the deployment functionality.
- **getNamedAccounts:** Retrieves the named accounts defined in the Hardhat configuration.
- **deploy:** The function used to deploy contracts.
- **deployer:** The account that will deploy the contract.
- **args:** Arguments for the contract constructor (empty in this case).
- **log:** If true, logs the deployment process to the console.

**Configuring Named Accounts:**

In your `hardhat.config.js` file, configure the named accounts:

```javascript
require('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition');

module.exports = {
  solidity: '0.8.0',
  networks: {
    hardhat: {},
    rinkeby: {
      url: 'https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID',
      accounts: ['0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY'],
    },
  },
  namedAccounts: {
    deployer: {
      default: 0, // here this will by default take the first account as deployer
    },
  },
};
```

**Running the Deployment Module:**

To deploy your contracts using the Ignition deployment module, run:

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --network hardhat
```

For deploying to Rinkeby or any other testnet, use:

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --network rinkeby
```

**Advanced Deployment Features:**

`@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules` offers several advanced features:

- **Conditional Deployments:** Deploy contracts only if certain conditions are met.
- **Deployment Dependencies:** Define dependencies between different contracts.
- **Upgrades and Migrations:** Manage contract upgrades and migrations seamlessly.

**Example of Conditional Deployment:**

You can add conditions to deploy contracts only when certain conditions are met:

```javascript
module.exports = async ({ deployments, getNamedAccounts }) => {
  const { deploy, get } = deployments;
  const { deployer } = await getNamedAccounts();

  const existingContract = await getOrNull('SimpleStorage');

  if (!existingContract) {
    await deploy('SimpleStorage', {
      from: deployer,
      args: [],
      log: true,
    });
  } else {
    console.log('SimpleStorage already deployed at:', existingContract.address);
  }
};
```

This script checks if `SimpleStorage` is already deployed. If not, it deploys it; otherwise, it logs the existing contract address.
