#### Writing Smart Contracts in Solidity

**Basic Syntax and Structure of Solidity:**

Solidity is a statically-typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Here's a brief overview of the basic syntax and structure:

1. **Pragma Directive:**

   This specifies the compiler version to be used.

   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
   ```

2. **Contract Declaration:**

   A contract is the fundamental building block of Ethereum applications.

   ```solidity
   contract MyContract {
       // Contract code goes here
   }
   ```

3. **State Variables:**

   Variables that hold the state of the contract.

   ```solidity
   uint256 public myNumber;
   string public myString;
   ```

4. **Functions:**

   Functions define the behavior of the contract. There are different types of functions: external, public, internal, and private.

   ```solidity
   function setMyNumber(uint256 _number) public {
       myNumber = _number;
   }

   function getMyNumber() public view returns (uint256) {
       return myNumber;
   }
   ```

**Writing a Simple Smart Contract:**

Let's write a simple smart contract called `SimpleStorage` that allows storing and retrieving a number.

1. Create a new file named `SimpleStorage.sol` in the `contracts/` directory.

   ```solidity
   // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

   contract SimpleStorage {
       uint256 private storedNumber;

       // Function to store a new number
       function set(uint256 _number) public {
           storedNumber = _number;
       }

       // Function to retrieve the stored number
       function get() public view returns (uint256) {
           return storedNumber;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Explanation:**

   - **Pragma Directive:** Specifies that the contract is written for Solidity version 0.8.0 or higher.
   - **State Variable:** `storedNumber` stores a single unsigned integer.
   - **Function `set`:** Takes a number as input and stores it in `storedNumber`.
   - **Function `get`:** Returns the stored number.

**Compiling Contracts with Hardhat:**

Once your contract is written, you need to compile it to check for errors and generate the necessary artifacts for deployment and interaction.

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the following command to compile your contracts:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

   This command will compile all the Solidity files in the `contracts/` directory and generate artifacts in the `artifacts/` directory.

**Dealing with Compilation Errors:**

If there are any errors, Hardhat will display them in the terminal. Common issues include:

- **Syntax Errors:** Misspelled keywords or incorrect syntax.
- **Version Mismatch:** The Solidity version specified in the pragma directive is not supported by the installed Solidity compiler version.

Review the error messages, fix the issues in your Solidity code, and re-run the `npx hardhat compile` command until your contracts compile successfully.

By the end of this lecture, you should be familiar with the basic syntax and structure of Solidity, how to write a simple smart contract, and how to compile your contracts using Hardhat. Understanding these fundamentals will prepare you for deploying and testing your smart contracts, which we will cover in the next lecture.
