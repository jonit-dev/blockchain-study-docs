#### Lesson 4: Challenges and Limitations - Scalability, Security, and Current Limitations

Blockchain technology, while transformative, is not without its challenges and limitations. As blockchain continues to evolve, addressing issues related to scalability, security, and various technical limitations is crucial for broader adoption and functionality. This lesson explores these primary challenges, providing a comprehensive understanding of what they entail and how they impact the deployment of blockchain solutions.

#### **Scalability**

One of the most pressing issues for blockchain technology is scalability. As blockchain networks grow in size and usage, they often struggle to process transactions quickly and efficiently.

- **Transaction Throughput**: Traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum can only handle a limited number of transactions per second (TPS). For example, Bitcoin can process about 4-7 TPS, while Ethereum handles around 15-25 TPS. In contrast, Visa's payment network can handle over 1,700 TPS.
- **Solutions**: Several solutions have been proposed and are in various stages of development to address scalability:
  - **Layer 2 Solutions**: Technologies like Lightning Network for Bitcoin and Plasma and Rollups for Ethereum aim to handle transactions off the main chain while securing finality on the main chain.
  - **Sharding**: This technique divides the network into smaller, manageable pieces, or "shards," each capable of processing its own set of transactions.
  - **New Consensus Algorithms**: Protocols such as Proof of Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) are being developed to increase throughput without compromising security.

#### 2024 update

1. **Sharding**: With sharding, blockchains can process more transactions by dividing them into smaller groups or "shards". This allows multiple nodes to validate each shard independently, increasing overall throughput.

Expected TPS: 1000-2000

2. **Optimistic Rollups**: This technique aggregates and compresses data before processing it on the mainnet, reducing the number of transactions that need to be verified.

Expected TPS: 500-1000

3. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: ZKPs enable secure and private transactions without revealing sensitive information. They can help increase TPS by reducing the amount of data needed to be processed.

Expected TPS: 200-400

4. **Off-chain solutions**: Off-chain solutions, such as Lightning Network for Bitcoin or OmiseGO for Ethereum, allow transactions to be processed off-chain and then settled on-chain, increasing throughput without sacrificing security.

Expected TPS: 1000-5000 (dependent on the specific implementation)

5. **Improved consensus algorithms**: New consensus algorithms like HotStuff, PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance), and HoneyBadgerBFT are designed to improve scalability and reduce latency, leading to higher TPS.

Expected TPS: 100-500

6. **Sidechains**: Sidechains allow for the transfer of assets between different blockchains, enabling interoperability and increasing overall throughput.

Expected TPS: 50-200 (dependent on the specific implementation)

7. **Graph-based scalability solutions**: Graph-based solutions like Polkadot's Relay Chain and Cosmos' Hub aim to connect multiple blockchain networks, allowing them to share resources and increase overall TPS.

Expected TPS: 100-500

Keep in mind that these estimates are based on current developments and may change as new breakthroughs emerge. The actual TPS achieved by each technology will depend on various factors, including the complexity of the implementation, network congestion, and security considerations.

#### **Security**

While blockchain is inherently secure due to its decentralized nature and cryptographic foundation, it is not immune to attacks and vulnerabilities.

- **51% Attacks**: If a single entity gains control of the majority of mining power on a blockchain, they can alter the addition of new blocks and, potentially, double-spend coins.
- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: As seen with various exploits in DeFi platforms, smart contracts can contain bugs that are exploitable unless carefully audited and tested.
- **Solutions**: Enhancing blockchain security involves rigorous security audits, developing more robust consensus mechanisms, and innovative cryptographic techniques.

#### **Current Limitations**

Besides scalability and security, there are several other limitations that blockchain technology currently faces.

- **Interoperability**: Many blockchain networks operate in silos and cannot interact with one another without intermediaries. Solutions like blockchain bridges and cross-chain protocols are being developed to enable seamless interaction between different blockchains.
- **Energy Consumption**: Particularly with Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains, the energy consumption is significant, raising environmental concerns. Transitioning to more energy-efficient consensus mechanisms like PoS is seen as a potential solution.
- **Regulatory and Legal Issues**: The decentralized nature of blockchain can sometimes be at odds with national laws and regulations, which can vary significantly across borders. This creates a complex legal landscape for blockchain applications, particularly in sectors like finance and healthcare.

### Conclusion

While blockchain offers revolutionary potential across various sectors, understanding its challenges and limitations is crucial for developers, businesses, and regulators alike. Addressing these issues requires continuous research, technological advancement, and cooperative regulatory frameworks to ensure that blockchain can fulfill its promise in a secure, efficient, and sustainable manner. As the technology matures, we can anticipate solutions that will mitigate these limitations, paving the way for more innovative and widespread use of blockchain.
