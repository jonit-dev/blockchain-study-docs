### Example of Using HashiCorp Vault with Foundry

#### 1. **Start Vault in Development Mode**

```bash
vault server -dev
```

This will start Vault in development mode with a default configuration.

#### 2. **Initialize and Unseal Vault**

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
vault operator init -key-shares=1 -key-threshold=1
vault operator unseal <Unseal Key>
vault login <Initial Root Token>
```

#### 3. **Store a Private Key in Vault**

```bash
vault kv put secret/my-private-key private_key="your_private_key_here"
```

#### 4. **Modify Deployment Script to Fetch the Secret from Vault**

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
const { Vault } = require('node-vault');
const { ethers } = require('ethers');

const vault = Vault({
  endpoint: process.env.VAULT_ADDR,
  token: process.env.VAULT_TOKEN,
});

async function main() {
  // Fetch secret from Vault
  const secret = await vault.read('secret/my-private-key');
  const privateKey = secret.data.private_key;

  // Setup provider and wallet
  const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(process.env.RPC_URL);
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);

  // Deploy contract
  const MyContract = await ethers.getContractFactory('MyContract', wallet);
  const contract = await MyContract.deploy();

  console.log('Contract deployed at:', contract.address);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

#### 5. **Set Environment Variables**

Ensure you have the following environment variables set in your `.env` file:

```plaintext
VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200
VAULT_TOKEN=<Your Vault Token>
RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

### Conclusion

Using a secure vault service, even a free or open-source one like HashiCorp Vault, can significantly improve the security of your secret management process. It helps avoid the pitfalls of hardcoding sensitive information and ensures better access control and auditability.
