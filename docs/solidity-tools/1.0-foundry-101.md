### Crash Course on Foundry for Solidity Development

Welcome to this crash course on Foundry for Solidity development! Foundry is an Ethereum development framework designed to simplify the development, testing, and deployment of smart contracts. In this course, we'll cover the most relevant topics to get you up and running with Foundry.

#### 1. Introduction to Foundry

**What is Foundry?**

Foundry is a fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust. It includes:

- `forge`: A CLI tool for smart contract development.
- `cast`: A command-line tool for interacting with EVM chains.

Foundry aims to provide a streamlined and efficient workflow for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.

**Installation**

To install Foundry, you need to install `foundryup` first. Run the following command:

```sh
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Then, install Foundry by running:

```sh
foundryup
```

#### 2. Setting Up a New Project

**Creating a New Project**

You can create a new Foundry project with the `forge init` command:

```sh
forge init my-foundry-project
cd my-foundry-project
```

This initializes a new Solidity project with the following structure:

```
my-foundry-project/
├── lib
├── script
├── src
│   └── Counter.sol
├── test
│   └── Counter.t.sol
└── foundry.toml
```

**Project Structure Overview**

- `src/`: Contains your Solidity source files.
- `test/`: Contains your test files.
- `script/`: Contains deployment and interaction scripts.
- `lib/`: For external libraries.
- `foundry.toml`: Configuration file for Foundry.

#### 3. Writing Smart Contracts

Let's write a simple smart contract in `src/Counter.sol`:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Counter {
    uint256 public count;

    function increment() public {
        count += 1;
    }

    function decrement() public {
        require(count > 0, "Counter: cannot decrement below zero");
        count -= 1;
    }
}
```

#### 4. Writing Tests

Testing is a crucial part of smart contract development. Foundry uses Solidity for writing tests, which ensures tests are run in the same environment as the contracts.

Create a test file in `test/Counter.t.sol`:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/Counter.sol";

contract CounterTest is Test {
    Counter counter;

    function setUp() public {
        counter = new Counter();
    }

    function testIncrement() public {
        counter.increment();
        assertEq(counter.count(), 1);
    }

    function testDecrement() public {
        counter.increment();
        counter.decrement();
        assertEq(counter.count(), 0);
    }

    function testFailDecrementBelowZero() public {
        counter.decrement();
    }
}
```

In this example, we use the `Test` contract from `forge-std` to provide useful testing utilities.

**Running Tests**

To run your tests, use the `forge test` command:

```sh
forge test
```

#### 5. Interacting with Smart Contracts

Foundry provides `cast` to interact with contracts. You can use `cast` to call contract functions, send transactions, and more.

**Example: Increment the Counter**

```sh
cast send <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "increment()" --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

**Example: Query the Counter**

```sh
cast call <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "count() returns (uint256)"
```

#### 6. Deployment

Deploying contracts with Foundry involves writing deployment scripts in the `script` directory.

**Example: Deployment Script**

Create `script/Deploy.s.sol`:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "forge-std/Script.sol";
import "../src/Counter.sol";

contract DeployCounter is Script {
    function run() external {
        vm.startBroadcast();
        new Counter();
        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
```

**Running Deployment Script**

To deploy the contract, use:

```sh
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
```

#### 7. Advanced Features

**Gas Snapshots**

Foundry allows you to take gas snapshots to compare gas costs of different functions. Add a gas snapshot in your test:

```solidity
function testGasIncrement() public {
    uint256 gasBefore = gasleft();
    counter.increment();
    uint256 gasAfter = gasleft();
    uint256 gasUsed = gasBefore - gasAfter;
    emit log_named_uint("Gas used for increment:", gasUsed);
}
```

Run the test to see the gas usage:

```sh
forge test --gas-report
```

**Forking Mainnet**

Foundry supports forking from mainnet for testing purposes. Update your `foundry.toml`:

```toml
[rpc_endpoints]
mainnet = "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"
```

Then, you can fork mainnet in your tests:

```solidity
function setUp() public {
    vm.createFork("mainnet");
    vm.selectFork(vm.activeFork());
}
```

## Foundry Deployment 101

Great! Assuming you have Ganache, Foundry, and all necessary dependencies installed, let's proceed with deploying a smart contract to a local Ganache network using Foundry. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Start Ganache

Make sure your Ganache local network is running. If it's not already started, you can start it using:

```bash
ganache-cli
```

This will launch Ganache on `http://127.0.0.1:8545` by default.

### Step 2: Initialize a Foundry Project

Navigate to your project directory and initialize a new Foundry project:

```bash
mkdir my-foundry-project
cd my-foundry-project
forge init
```

### Step 3: Create a Smart Contract

Inside your project directory, create a smart contract in the `src` directory. For example, `MyContract.sol`:

```solidity
// src/MyContract.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyContract {
    uint256 public value;

    function setValue(uint256 _value) public {
        value = _value;
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Write a Deployment Script

Next, create a deployment script in the `script` directory. For example, `DeployMyContract.s.sol`:

```solidity
// script/DeployMyContract.s.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "forge-std/Script.sol";
import "../src/MyContract.sol";

contract DeployMyContract is Script {
    function run() external {
        vm.startBroadcast();
        new MyContract();
        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Configure Foundry

Ensure Foundry is configured to connect to your local Ganache instance. You can specify this in the `foundry.toml` configuration file:

```toml
[profile.default]
rpc_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8545"
```

### Step 6: Deploy the Contract

Use Foundry to deploy your contract. Run the deployment script with the following command:

```bash
forge script script/DeployMyContract.s.sol --broadcast
```

### Step 7: Verify Deployment

To verify that your contract was deployed successfully, you can check the Ganache logs. You should see a transaction that deployed your contract. Additionally, you can interact with your contract using a tool like `ethers.js` or `web3.js`.

Here’s an example of how you might interact with the deployed contract using `ethers.js`:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require('ethers');

const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('http://127.0.0.1:8545');
const contractAddress = 'YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
const contractABI = [
  'function value() view returns (uint256)',
  'function setValue(uint256 _value) public',
];

const signer = provider.getSigner();
const myContract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, signer);

async function main() {
  // Set a new value
  let tx = await myContract.setValue(42);
  await tx.wait();

  // Get the value
  let value = await myContract.value();
  console.log('The value is:', value.toString());
}

main();
```

#### 8. Conclusion

Foundry provides a powerful and efficient toolkit for Solidity development, from writing and testing contracts to deploying them. By leveraging its tools, you can streamline your development workflow and focus on building robust and secure smart contracts.
