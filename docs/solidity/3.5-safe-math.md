### Chapter: SafeMath in Solidity

PS: This is not needed anymore on new versions of Solidity, however, it is still a good practice to know about it.

#### Introduction to SafeMath

In Solidity, overflow and underflow errors in arithmetic operations can lead to serious vulnerabilities in smart contracts. SafeMath is a library that provides safe arithmetic operations, automatically checking for these errors and reverting the transaction if one occurs. This chapter explores the use of SafeMath, its main use cases, and provides concise examples.

#### What is SafeMath?

SafeMath is a Solidity library that ensures safe execution of arithmetic operations by adding checks for overflow and underflow conditions. When such conditions are detected, the operation reverts, preventing unexpected behaviors and potential exploits.

#### Main Use Cases of SafeMath

1. **Token Contracts**: Handling token balances and transfers safely.
2. **Crowdfunding Contracts**: Managing contributions without errors.
3. **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Applications**: Ensuring safe financial computations.
4. **Voting Systems**: Accurate and safe vote counting.

#### Using SafeMath in Solidity

To use SafeMath, import the library and apply its functions to your arithmetic operations.

##### Example 1: Safe Addition

Let's consider a simple contract that increments a counter safely.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol";

contract SafeCounter {
    using SafeMath for uint256;
    uint256 public counter;

    function increment(uint256 value) public {
        counter = counter.add(value);
    }
}
```

In this example:

- `using SafeMath for uint256;` allows `uint256` variables to use SafeMath functions.
- The `increment` function safely adds `value` to `counter`, reverting on overflow.

##### Example 2: Safe Subtraction

A contract to safely decrement a counter:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol";

contract SafeCounter {
    using SafeMath for uint256;
    uint256 public counter;

    function decrement(uint256 value) public {
        counter = counter.sub(value);
    }
}
```

Here, the `decrement` function safely subtracts `value` from `counter`, reverting on underflow.

##### Example 3: Safe Multiplication

A contract to safely double a stored value:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol";

contract SafeMultiplier {
    using SafeMath for uint256;
    uint256 public value;

    function doubleValue() public {
        value = value.mul(2);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `doubleValue` function safely multiplies `value` by 2, reverting on overflow.

##### Example 4: Safe Division

A contract to safely halve a stored value:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol";

contract SafeDivider {
    using SafeMath for uint256;
    uint256 public value;

    function halveValue() public {
        value = value.div(2);
    }
}
```

The `halveValue` function safely divides `value` by 2, reverting on division by zero.

#### Conclusion

SafeMath is an essential library for Solidity developers, providing functions for safe arithmetic operations. By using SafeMath, you can prevent overflow and underflow errors, ensuring the reliability and security of your smart contracts.
