### Your first Solidity Smart Contract

#### Step 1: Setup Remix IDE

1. Open your web browser and go to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the File Explorers tab and name it `SimpleStorage.sol`.

#### Step 2: Define the Solidity Version

Start by specifying the Solidity compiler version to ensure your code is compatible with the compiler used by Remix.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```

Including an SPDX license identifier comment at the top is considered best practice as it clarifies the licensing of the code, which is important for open source projects.

#### Step 3: Create the Contract

Define the structure of your contract named `SimpleStorage`. This is the main body where all your code will reside.

```solidity
contract SimpleStorage {
    // We will add variables and functions here
}
```

#### Step 4: Declare a State Variable

A state variable is stored on the blockchain and represents the state of the contract. Let's add a simple unsigned integer variable to store a number.

```solidity
uint256 public storedData;
```

The `uint256` type is an unsigned integer of 256 bits, which is a common choice for storing values. The `public` keyword automatically creates a function that allows other contracts and clients to read the value of `storedData`.

#### Step 5: Write Functions to Interact with the State

1. **Setter Function:** This function allows users to update the value of `storedData`.

```solidity
function set(uint256 x) public {
    storedData = x;
}
```

2. **Getter Function:** Even though Solidity automatically creates a getter for public state variables, let's explicitly define a getter for educational purposes.

```solidity
function get() public view returns (uint256) {
    return storedData;
}
```

The `view` keyword in the function declaration tells the compiler that this function does not alter the state of the contract.

### Step 6: Deploy and Test the Contract

- In Remix, go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" panel.
- Make sure the environment is set to "JavaScript VM" for testing purposes.
- Click "Deploy" to deploy your contract within the virtual blockchain provided by Remix.

After deploying, you can interact with your contract by calling the `set` and `get` functions using the Remix interface to see how the state changes.

This setup provides a hands-on approach to learning Solidity basics within an IDE specifically designed for smart contract development. This approach emphasizes understanding by directly engaging with the code and seeing the effects of your changes live.
