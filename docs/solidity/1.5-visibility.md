In Solidity, visibility modifiers dictate who can access and interact with contracts' variables and functions. Understanding these modifiers is essential for proper contract security and functionality. Here, we'll cover the four main visibility modifiers used in Solidity: `public`, `private`, `internal`, and `external`.

### Visibility Modifiers

#### 1. `public`

- **Applies to**: Variables and functions.
- **Access**: From within the contract, by derived contracts, and externally.
- A `public` variable automatically generates a getter function, which allows other contracts and external clients to read its value.
- `public` functions are part of the contract interface, making them callable from other contracts and transactions.

  **Example**:

  ```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

  contract MyContract {
      uint public data = 10; // Automatically accessible externally via getter.

      function getData() public view returns (uint) {
          return data;
      }
  }
  ```

#### 2. `private`

- **Applies to**: Variables and functions.
- **Access**: Only from within the contract in which they are declared.
- `private` ensures that no other contract, including derived ones, can access the variable or function.

  **Example**:

  ```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

  contract MyContract {
      uint private data = 10; // Only accessible within this contract.

      function getData() public view returns (uint) {
          return data;
      }
  }
  ```

#### 3. `internal`

- **Applies to**: Variables and functions.
- **Access**: From within the contract and by derived contracts, but not externally.
- `internal` is similar to `protected` in other object-oriented languages and is useful for abstract contracts or base contracts.

  **Example**:

  ```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

  contract Base {
      uint internal baseData = 10; // Accessible within this contract and derived ones.

      function baseFunction() internal pure returns (uint) {
          return 5;
      }
  }

  contract Derived is Base {
      function readBaseData() public view returns (uint) {
          return baseData; // Accessible because it's internal.
      }
  }
  ```

#### 4. `external`

- **Applies to**: Functions (not variables).
- **Access**: Can only be called from outside the contract, not from other functions inside the same contract, unless they are invoked through `this`.
- Often used for functions that need to be called only from external contracts or transactions.

  **Example**:

  ```solidity
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

  contract MyContract {
      function externalFunction() external pure returns (uint) {
          return 10;
      }

      // Error if called from another function within this contract, unless called using `this.externalFunction()`.
  }
  ```

### Best Practices

- Use `private` and `internal` to restrict access to sensitive functions and state variables.
- Utilize `external` for functions that are expected to be called only externally, which can save gas compared to `public` functions.
- Default to the least permissive visibility to adhere to the principle of least privilege, enhancing contract security.

By correctly applying these visibility modifiers, you can control how your smart contracts interact with users, other contracts, and inheritors, thereby creating a more secure and robust decentralized application.
