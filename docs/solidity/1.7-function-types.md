### Solidity Function Types Based on State Mutability

In Solidity, every function declaration can include special keywords that indicate how the function interacts with the contract's state. These keywords—`view`, `pure`, `payable`, and the default (no keyword)—help manage how functions read, modify, or interact with the blockchain data.

#### 1. `view` Functions

- **Keyword**: `view`
- **Characteristics**: Functions declared with `view` promise not to modify the state.
- **Usage**: Suitable for functions that need to access the state but not alter it.
- **Gas Cost**: No gas cost when called externally from a transaction (off-chain), but gas is used when called internally from another function that is part of a transaction.

**Example**:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract UserInfo {
    uint public age = 25;

    // This function reads the state but does not modify it.
    function getAge() public view returns (uint) {
        return age;
    }
}
```

#### 2. `pure` Functions

- **Keyword**: `pure`
- **Characteristics**: Functions declared as `pure` promise not to read from or modify the state.
- **Usage**: Ideal for functions that do computation or processing without needing any data stored in the blockchain.
- **Gas Cost**: Like `view` functions, `pure` functions incur no gas cost when called externally.

**Example**:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Math {
    // This function does not interact with the state at all.
    function add(uint a, uint b) public pure returns (uint) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

#### 3. Default (No Keyword)

- **Characteristics**: Functions without any of these keywords can modify the contract's state.
- **Usage**: Default functions are used when the function needs to change the state in some way.
- **Gas Cost**: These functions always require gas to execute because they use computational resources and modify state.

**Example**:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Counter {
    uint public count = 0;

    // This function modifies the state by incrementing `count`.
    function increment() public {
        count += 1;
    }
}
```

#### 4. `payable` Functions

- **Keyword**: `payable`
- **Characteristics**: Functions declared as `payable` can receive Ether along with the call.
- **Usage**: Necessary for any function that needs to accept Ether as part of its operation.
- **Gas Cost**: Requires gas to execute because they can modify the state by updating balances.

**Example**:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Donation {
    // This function can receive Ether.
    function donate() public payable {
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

Understanding these function types based on state mutability in Solidity is crucial for writing efficient and secure smart contracts. It helps developers ensure that they are using the blockchain's resources optimally, avoiding unnecessary gas costs, and maintaining clarity about the function's effects on the contract's state.
