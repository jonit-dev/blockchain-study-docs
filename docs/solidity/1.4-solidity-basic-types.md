In Solidity, the types used can be categorized into value types and reference types. Here's a brief overview of each, with an emphasis on the commonly used Solidity basic value types.

### Value Types

Value types are variables that hold their data directly. They are not stored by reference, and they are always copied when assigned to other variables or passed to functions.

1. **Boolean**:

   - **Type**: `bool`
   - Represents Boolean values `true` and `false`.
   - Example usage: `bool isActive = true;`

2. **Integer**:

   - **Types**: `int` / `uint`
   - `int` represents signed integers of various sizes (e.g., `int256`, `int8`).
   - `uint` represents unsigned integers (non-negative numbers), with `uint256` being the default.
   - Example usage: `int256 count = -123; uint256 balance = 456;`

3. **Address**:

   - **Type**: `address`
   - Holds a 20-byte Ethereum address.
   - Has members like `balance` and methods like `transfer`.
   - Example usage: `address userAddress = 0x123...;`

4. **Bytes**:

   - **Types**: `bytes1`, `bytes2`, ..., `bytes32`, and `bytes`
   - Fixed-size and dynamically sized byte arrays.
   - `bytes` is dynamically-sized and is similar to `byte[]`.
   - Example usage: `bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked("hello")); bytes memory data = "dynamic size";`

5. **Fixed-Point Numbers**:

   - **Types**: `fixed` / `ufixed`
   - Solidity currently does not fully support fixed-point numbers, but they are planned for future releases.
   - Planned to represent numbers with fractional parts.

6. **Enum**:
   - Defines a custom type with a restricted range of possible values.
   - Example usage:
     ```solidity
     enum State { Active, Inactive, Prohibited }
     State public currentState = State.Active;
     ```

### Reference Types

Reference types do not store the variable's actual data but a reference to it. They are more complex as they involve understanding storage locationsâ€”`memory`, `storage`, and `calldata`.

1. **Arrays**:

   - Can be fixed-size or dynamically-sized.
   - Example usage: `uint[] public numbers;` (dynamic array)

2. **Structs**:

   - Allows the definition of new types representing a group of variables.
   - Example usage:
     ```solidity
     struct User {
         string name;
         uint age;
     }
     User public newUser;
     ```

3. **Mappings**:
   - Collections of key/value pairs. All keys are unique, and for each key, there is a single value.
   - Example usage: `mapping(address => uint) public balances;`

### Special Types

1. **Function Types**:
   - Variables can be of function types, allowing functions to be assigned to variables or passed as arguments.
   - Example: `function(uint) external pure returns (uint) func;`

Understanding these types is fundamental to effective smart contract development in Solidity. Each type serves specific purposes in controlling how data is stored, how memory is managed, and how the blockchain interacts with that data.
