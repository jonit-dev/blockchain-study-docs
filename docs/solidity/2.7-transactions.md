### Sending Values Between Wallets Using Solidity

Sending values (Ether) between wallets is a fundamental feature of Ethereum smart contracts. This lesson will cover how to send Ether, handle edge cases, and ensure safe and efficient transfers.

### Basic Ether Transfer

In Solidity, Ether transfers can be done using the following methods:

- `transfer()`
- `send()`
- `call()`

#### `transfer()`

The `transfer` method sends Ether and reverts the transaction if the transfer fails. It forwards 2300 gas to the recipient, which is enough to log an event or complete a basic operation but not enough to execute complex logic.

```solidity
function sendViaTransfer(address payable recipient) public payable {
    recipient.transfer(msg.value);
}
```

#### `send()`

The `send` method also forwards 2300 gas but returns a boolean indicating success. You should always check this return value to handle failures gracefully.

```solidity
function sendViaSend(address payable recipient) public payable {
    bool success = recipient.send(msg.value);
    require(success, "Send failed");
}
```

#### `call()`

The `call` method is the most flexible and recommended way to send Ether. It forwards all remaining gas and returns a boolean and data. This method is the most secure against reentrancy attacks when used correctly.

```solidity
function sendViaCall(address payable recipient) public payable {
    (bool success, ) = recipient.call{value: msg.value}("");
    require(success, "Call failed");
}
```

### Handling Edge Cases

#### Reentrancy Attacks

Reentrancy attacks occur when a contract makes an external call to another untrusted contract before it resolves all internal logic. To prevent these, always use the **checks-effects-interactions** pattern.

##### Example of Vulnerable Contract

```solidity
contract Vulnerable {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function withdraw() public {
        uint balance = balances[msg.sender];
        require(balance > 0);

        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: balance}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");

        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}
```

##### Secured Contract

```solidity
contract Secure {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function withdraw() public {
        uint balance = balances[msg.sender];
        require(balance > 0);

        balances[msg.sender] = 0;

        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: balance}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }
}
```

#### Gas Limits

When using `transfer` and `send`, be mindful of the gas limits. The 2300 gas stipend might not be sufficient for complex operations in the recipient contract. This can cause the transfer to fail unexpectedly.

#### Fallback and Receive Functions

Recipient contracts should implement a `receive` function to handle plain Ether transfers and a `fallback` function for other cases.

```solidity
contract Receiver {
    event Received(address sender, uint amount);

    receive() external payable {
        emit Received(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }

    fallback() external payable {
        emit Received(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
}
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use `call` for Sending Ether**: The `call` method is the most flexible and avoids issues with gas limits.
2. **Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern**: Always update the state before making external calls to prevent reentrancy attacks.
3. **Error Handling**: Always handle errors and check the return values of `send` and `call`.
4. **Gas Efficiency**: Be mindful of gas usage, especially when interacting with complex contracts.
5. **Properly Handle Reverts**: Use `require` to ensure that transfers succeed or provide meaningful error messages.

### Example Contract

Here is a complete example of a secure contract that allows users to deposit and withdraw Ether safely.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SafeTransfer {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;

        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Withdrawal failed");
    }

    function checkBalance() public view returns (uint) {
        return balances[msg.sender];
    }
}
```

This contract allows users to deposit Ether, withdraw it securely, and check their balance. It uses the `call` method to ensure that the withdrawal function is safe from reentrancy attacks and handles gas limitations effectively.
